I worked locally in creating branches and files on my local machine and also pushing to github. then i tried not 'committing' the changes and just pushing to see what will happen and then i noticed the changes i made didnt take effect. so now i now know the main reason to always update your changes in github by git commit command.
I also was exposed to using the internet to find new commands i could use which i learnt "git branch" for displaying available branches, "git checkout -b main" for creating a branch called ' main' and then switching to the newly created branch.
